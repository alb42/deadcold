===================================
***  PLOTLINE SCRIPT REFERENCE  ***
===================================

0.CONVENTIONS

	The DeadCold plotline script language was derived from the
	GearHead scripting language, which was itself derived from
	the original version of the DeadCold language. Unless otherwise
	noted, all conventions from GH apply here.

	In the listings, parameters are listed in square brackets: []
	Optional parts are listed in greater than/less than brackets: <>
	Spacing is important. If no spaces are indicated here, no
	spaces should appear in the script. Commands should be separated
	from one another by spaces unless otherwise noted.

	If a trigger has more than one parameter, the parameters are
	separated by a % sign.

1.TRIGGERS

	10MIN
	This trigger is set once every 10 minutes. Note that it supercedes
	the MINUTE trigger, and is itself superceded by the HOUR trigger.

	ALARM
	This trigger is generated when an alarm trap is set off or
	when a computer hacking attempt fails.

	EN[ terrain type ]
	This trigger is generated when the player uses the "activate
	terrain" command (>).

	{ INTERNAL JUMP }
	GOTO[ label ]
	This trigger is used to create a line of script which may not
	be directly triggered by game events, but which may be called
	by an ELSE or a GOTO command.

	HOUR
	This trigger is generated once per hour by the game. It supercedes
	all other time triggers.

	MINUTE
	This trigger is generated once every minute by the game.

	MS[ code ]
	This trigger is generated when the player moves onto a map
	tile whose SPECIAL field is nonzero. The code is the SPECIAL
	value for this square.

	NC[ code ]
	This trigger is generated when the player sees a new monster
	for the first time. The code is the type of monster seen.

	START
	This trigger is generated when a new level is entered.

2.COMMANDS

	ALERT [critter gfx]
	This command causes all critters whose graphic is the specified
	character to immediately target the PC. Critter gfx is case sensitive.
	WARNING: If the type provided is a very common critter, use of
	this command may slow down the game considerably.

	CHANGETERR [terrain to change] [change to this]
	This command changes Terr1 to Terr2 over the entire map.

	CHOKE
	This command will cause the PC to take 2d5 asphyxiation damage.

	GOLEFT
	GORIGHT
	These commands are invoked when the player enters a transitway
	tube. They bring the player to the next logical module.

	IF= [value1] [value2] <ELSE [label]>
	If value1 = value2, continue on with this line. If not,
	jump to LABEL. The LABEL must be formatted as the trigger of
	the line to use next.

	IFG [value1] [value2] <ELSE [label]>
	If value1 > value2, continue on with this line. If not,
	jump to LABEL. The LABEL must be formatted as the trigger of
	the line to use next. Note that > can't be used as the greater
	than symbol since it's the end marker for the line... bummer.

	IFKEY [item number] <ELSE [label]>
	If the player has the specified key item, continue on with
	this line. Otherwise jump to LABEL.

	IFYN [prompt message] <ELSE [label]>
	Print a Yes/No prompt for the user. If the player selects "Y",
	continue on with this line. If "N", goto the ELSE line.

	PRINT [label]
	This command will print a message in the dialog area.

	V= [idnum] [value]
	This command may be used to assign the value of variable IDNUM.

	V+ [idnum] [value]
	This command may be used to add a quantity to the current value
	of variable IDNUM.


3.MISCELLANEOUS

	MSG[label] <[Text Message Here.]>
	Game messages are stored as string attributes in the same place
	as the events.

	P[ Identifier ]
	This variable may be used to access a play value. The defined play
	values are as follows:
		L	->	Leakage; how many PC armor parts aren't sealed

	V[ code ]
	Variables may be assigned by the script. Use this to dereference
	the value stored in a variable.

4.ASSIGNED VARIABLES

	The following variable numbers have been assigned in the DeadCold
	campaign.
	1.Intro message: Leave ship / Leave Hangar / Stupid Joke
	2.Module "B" Life Support Off / On
	3.Modume "B" Air Depletion - Player starts taking damage around 1000
	4.Module "D" Alert Status

5.ASSIGNED MAP SQUARES
